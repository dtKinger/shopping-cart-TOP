# Shopping Cart App (React)
Vite Build React App w/ TailwindCSS Shopping Cart

## Key Learnings
- Placeholder "Loading" image until product fetch completes
- useContext() with the special Outlet component to deliver the Cart items
- Creating a Router object with nested routes. createBrowserRouter() here.
- Render most of the app inside a Layout which is a header for navigation and cart, loading the sub-routes below the static header.
